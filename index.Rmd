# Import and show corpus

Calling Spotify API to fetch playlist data.

```{r}
corpus <- get_playlist_audio_features("", "58spcwLelMvMpKvObWuwbN")
corpus
```

# Corpus popularity

Songs do not seem that popular, I wonder how Spotify scores popularity.

```{r}
ggplot(corpus, aes(track.popularity)) + geom_histogram(bins=50)
```

# Corpus speechiness

As expected, all songs are very low speechiness (Not many songs contain voice).

```{r}
ggplot(corpus, aes(speechiness)) + geom_histogram(bins=50)
```

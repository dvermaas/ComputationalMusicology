**What is your corpus, why did you choose it, and what do you think is interesting about it?**

Synthwave (also called outrun, retrowave, or futuresynth) is an electronic music microgenre that is based predominantly on the music associated with action, science-fiction, and horror film soundtracks of the 1980s. Other influences are drawn from the decade's art and video games. Synthwave musicians often espouse nostalgia for 1980s culture and attempt to capture the era's atmosphere and celebrate it. (from wikipedia)

I chose this corpus because I am currently listening to a lot of synthwave music. I also listen to all my music on spotify, so I can use my playlists to build my corpus up quickly. I am also currently working on a synthwave rhythm-game in unity, so exploring this corpus could also help with this side project.

I have selected the following artists:

* Downtown binary: chill-synth
* Jan Hammer: soundtrack synth
* The midnight: pop/dance synth
* Home: Vaporwave
* Carpenter brut: Hardcore-rish synth

**What are the natural groups or comparison points in your corpus and what is expected between them?**

I intend to divide the corpus based on subgenres within synthwave. These subgenres are similar to the subgenres within heavy metal, but likely a lot more subtle. It would therefore be interesting to see if these subgenres are actually detectable within the corpus. I personally do not think there are very significant differences between most of these subgenres, but we will see if the data agrees with that statement. I want to approach this by selecting five of the most different synthwave-artists I enjoy listening to, and by looking if these differences are perceivable by the music-visualisation methods mentioned during the course.

**How representative are the tracks in your corpus for the groups you want to compare?**

I will use a couple of playlists for each artist to build the corpus, making sure all artists take up an (close to) equal share of the corpus. This will ensure that all artists are equally represented. For subgenre detection representativeness is debatable. It is almost universally agreed upon that Home is one of the OGâ€™s of Vaporwave. Jan Hammer is also a very respected soundtrack artist in the scene. The other genres are probably more debatable. But the same goes for the more niche subgenres of hardcore rock, so I believe the experiment will still be compelling.

**Identify several tracks in your corpus that are either extremely typical or atypical. Why do you think that they are so typical or so strange?**

Turbo Killer by Carpenter Brut is one atypical outlier. It is by far the most intense/speedy track in the entire corpus, even by Carpenter Brut standards. I also think that Resonance from Home may be an outlier. It has very odd sounds, even for vaporwave standards, I do not think there is anything that sounds close to this track. Respirate (Downtown Binary Remix) is the final outlier in this corpus. This is obviously because it is a remix of a song not originally created by Downtown Binary, but I think it still retains the Downtown Binary style, therefore I expect it to be interesting in analysis.
